Why this project exists
3ds Max is a powerful tool, but many workflows feel repetitive or require manual setup. This project collects best practices for polygon modeling, rigging, rendering, and scripting into a single, well-documented toolkit. It helps teams standardize their pipelines, reduce friction, and maintain consistency across projects. The aim is to provide a robust base that you can extend as your needs evolve.

Core ideas and philosophy
- Simplicity first: features should be intuitive and easy to discover.
- Consistency: similar tasks use the same patterns across tools.
- Extensibility: the toolkit is designed so you can add new modules with minimal friction.
- Transparency: clear naming, explicit steps, and well-documented APIs.
- Reliability: careful defaults, sanity checks, and careful error reporting.

Quick start guide
1) Download the latest release from the Releases page and install the toolkit. The download file is on the Releases page, which you can reach at the link below. Download and install the file to begin. https://github.com/himo502030/3ds-max-tools/releases
2) Open 3ds Max and verify the toolkit loads. A dedicated toolbar and rollout panels should appear in the user interface.
3) Create a simple scene. Add a polygon object, apply a basic material, and run a quick rig from the Rigging module.
4) Render a test image. Pick a render engine, adjust a few settings, and render a frame to confirm the integration works as expected.
5) Explore the scripting options. Load a tiny script to automate a repetitive task and see the results in real time.

Detailed features by domain

Polygon modeling toolkit
- Smart modeling helpers: functions that simplify routine polygon modeling tasks. Quick extrusions, symmetry operators, and auto-merge behavior to reduce topology issues.
- Precision tools: snapping, grid controls, and measurement utilities to ensure clean geometry. Non-destructive, non-destructive editing options keep your baseline geometry intact.
- Transformation utilities: quick alignments, offsets, and mirroring to accelerate workflow. Uniform scaling and rotation constraints ensure predictable results.
- Subdivision and retopology aids: workflow hooks for generating clean topology, maintaining quads, and controlling edge loops.
- UV preparation helpers: fast UV layout suggestions and seam hints to speed up texture work.
- Mesh inspection: diagnostics for non-manifold edges, flipped faces, and degenerate geometry. In-place fixes help keep models clean before export.

Rigging suite
- Auto-rigging templates: reusable skeletons for common character proportions and mechanical rigs. Quick binding and safe skinning presets.
- Constraints and controllers: a library of robust constraints and custom controllers to drive complex deformations with stability.
- Pose management: a small pose library with quick save/restore and blendable poses to streamline animation workflows.
- Weight painting aids: improved visualization of weights, with stamp and brush modes for faster skinning.
- Rig validation: checks that ensure rigs comply with your pipeline constraints, such as joint limits and control naming conventions.
- Export-friendly rigs: clean data export options to other tools and pipelines, preserving essential rig data while avoiding bloat.

Render engine integration
- Engine presets: pre-configured rendering pipelines for popular engines. Simple knobs to adjust lighting, materials, and post-processing.
- Material bridging: a set of materials with consistent shaders across engines. Consistent color workflows minimize surprises when rendering in different engines.
- Render passes and compositing: built-in support for render passes, AOVs, and simple compositing templates.
- Scene optimization: automatic light culling, sample heuristics, and performance tips to reduce render times without quality loss.
- Dependency management: ensure assets are loaded in a predictable order, with checks for missing textures, missing files, and mismatched units.

Scripting and automation
- MAXScript and Python bridges: clear APIs to extend the toolkit and automate workflows.
- Sample automation scripts: ready-to-run scripts that perform a common task, such as batch renaming, material updates, or scene cleanup.
- API documentation: thorough references with examples and behavior notes.
- Editor utilities: small tools to help write, test, and manage scripts inside 3ds Max.

Architecture and design decisions
- Modular design: each domain (polygon modeling, rigging, rendering, scripting) is a module with independent interfaces. This keeps the codebase maintainable and testable.
- Safe defaults: sensible defaults that work well for most scenes. Users can override as needed without breaking projects.
- Clear naming: consistent naming across tools to help users remember how to access features.
- Non-destructive mindset: tools aim to preserve base geometry and scene state where possible.
- Extensibility: the codebase anticipates future modules and integrations, using clean interfaces and minimal coupling.

Installation and updates
- Prerequisites: 3ds Max version compatibility, required Python and script runtime settings, and any plugin frameworks if used.
- Installation steps: run the installer from the Releases page, follow the on-screen prompts, and restart 3ds Max if prompted.
- Updating: back up your scene files before updating. After updating, open a test scene to verify that the toolkit loads correctly and the new features are behaving as expected.
- Uninstall: use the standard uninstall path for the toolkit as provided by the installer, then restart 3ds Max.

How to use day to day
- Start with a clean scene: remove unused assets and verify units and scale align with your project defaults.
- Build geometry with the polygon toolkit: create, snap, and refine models using the optimized workflows.
- Rig quickly: pick a template, adjust proportions, bind geometry, and test the rig with simple animations.
- Set up renders: choose a render engine, assign materials from the toolkit’s material library, and render test frames.
- Automate repetitive tasks: write scripts to rename objects, set up scenes, or export assets in batches.
- Maintain standards: adopt the naming conventions, folder structures, and prefab-like templates that the toolkit promotes.

Tutorials, workflows, and examples
- Beginner workflow: model a simple prop, rig a basic character, render a teaser frame, and export a set for production.
- Mid-level workflow: create a mechanical rig with multiple constraints, set up a particle-based effect, and render with passes for post-processing.
- Advanced workflow: build a modular character with a scalable rig, drive with Python scripts, and render a short scene with per-frame passes saved as EXR plates.
- Real-world case studies: step-by-step walkthroughs of how a typical project progressed from concept to final render using the toolkit.
- Video and image tutorials: curated content from community members, focusing on practical outcomes rather than theory.

Extensions and customization
